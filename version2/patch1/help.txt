Potential Issues:

If you installed TaskTracker in Program Files folder or some other restricted
folder, you will need to run the program as administrator or it will not be able to
save tasks to the task file. Either change your task file location or program
folder location, or configure your shortcut to run the program as administrator.

Custom sound files must be .wav files and of a fairly small size.

Unreachable tasks and sound files will cause the program to crash.

Invalid RGBA colour values will also cause the program to crash.
