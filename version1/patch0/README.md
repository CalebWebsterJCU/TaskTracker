# Introducing TaskTracker!

Version 1 of TaskTracker - the ultimate task management program - is OUT NOW! Check it out [here](https://github.com/CalebWebsterJCU/TaskTracker/tree/master/version1/patch0)

TaskTracker, developed by JCU IT student Caleb Webster in October 2020, is a python kivy application package that stores
the user's tasks like a TODO list. The user can view, sort, add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are shown as
rows in a grid, and the program utilises a simplistic layout to make the UI as fast and responsive as possible.

There's not much else to say except *__get over to github and grab yourself the latest version of TaskTracker!__*
