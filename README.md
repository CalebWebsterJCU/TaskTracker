## Description
_TaskTracker_ is a Python Kivy application that tracks the user's tasks and allows the user to:
* Add tasks
* Sort tasks
* Complete/uncomplete tasks
* Change task prioritites

All in one easy-to-use application.
## How it works
TaskTracker stores tasks in a CSV file which it reads tasks from and writes tasks to. Tasks are displayed as buttons in a scrollable list within the GUI. Pressing a task button will mark it as completed, changing its colour and moving it to the bottom if _grouping_ is on.

Menu buttons and input fields for adding tasks are located to the right of the application window.

There are two information text panels on the top and bottom of the application. The top panel shows how many tasks you have left to complete. The bottom panel displays information about tasks and error messages when you do something bad.

TaskTracker includes many features to help you stay on top of your tasks. Click the "Help" button to view these features and their functions, along with other special features.
